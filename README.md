# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose:
This analysis was performed to review the prodcution data for insights that will help the manufacturing team. 

The following <ins>analysis</ins> will be done in this activity:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes,
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots,
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population,
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Resources: 
MechaCar CSV file : [MechaCar_mpg.csv](https://github.com/kritika2604/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCar_mpg.csv)</br>
Suspension coil file: [Suspension_Coil.csv](https://github.com/kritika2604/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Suspension_Coil.csv)
## Tools used: 
Rstudio

## Analysis 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
he MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. 

- A multiple linear regression model was developed using R that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.
- Each independent variable was looked to determine if there is a significant relationship with the dependent variable(mpg) using `lm()` function.

- Each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model- 
  - Ground clearance, vehicle length (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the ground clearance and vehicle length have a significant impact on miles per gallon value.

  - The multi linear model is - 
  
    ```
    mpg = 1.25e-3 * vehicle_weigth + 6.27 * vehicle_length + 6.88e-2 * spoiler_angle + 3.55 * ground_clearance -3.41 * AWD - 1.04e+2
    ```
    or can be written as,
    ```
    mpg = 6.27 * vehicle_length + 3.55 * ground_clearance -3.41 * AWD - 104
    ```
  - The slope value is not zero here as the **r<sup>2</sup> value** is **0.7149** and the higher the correlation is between two variables, the more that one variable can explain/predict the value of the other.

  - This linear model is **fairly efficient to predict** mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
    
 ## Analysis 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
 The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. 
 
  - Statistical summary for all the lots:

  - Statistical summary lot wise:

   ## Analysis 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
   T-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

  - T-test on Manufacturing Lot 1 shows a p-value = 1 --> Which shows that the p-value is higher than the significance level(=0.05). Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically same/similar.

  - T-test on Manufacturing Lot 2 shows a p-value = 0.6 --> Which shows that the p-value is higher than the significance level(=0.05). Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

  - T-test on Manufacturing Lot 3 shows a p-value = 0.04 --> Which shows that the p-value is lesser than the significance level(=0.05). Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically not similar.

  - T-test on complete manufacturing lots shows a p-value = 0.06 --> Which shows that the p-value is higher than the significance level(=0.05). Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

  ## Analysis 4: Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
  This analysis was made to statistical study and compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers. 
  - What metric or metrics are you going to test?
  The mpg data is a key feature which has to be competitive with the available other competition car models of same bodytype(sedans, SUVs etc) 
  If available, even hybrid and EV options to be tested on like to like basis. 
  
  - What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
  The null hypothesis typically states that NO differences exist between the variables or groups of interest.
  In this case, the null hypothesis might be of the similar lines of the mpg values of all the manufacturing lots are equal. 
  
  - What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, shall be used to test this hypothesis, as it is used to compare the means of a continuous numerical variable across a number of groups. 
  
  - What data is needed to run the statistical test?
  Already existing data of "mpg" along with the body type information will be required for this analysis. 
  Incase hybrid models are included then perhaps range(Miles) per full charge would be a data which will be sort after.
